# OpenAI-CartPole-v1
This repository contains my code file of  training the CartPole game problem of OpenAI gym.
Here I have used a Deep Neural Network to train a supervised model on CartPole-v1 problem. For details about the problem visit https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/. After generating the training data and actual training of the model a test run of 25 episodes is done. 
I am also uploading a pickle file which already contains training data generated by me. This can directly be loaded for training instead of generating the data.
